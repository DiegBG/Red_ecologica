# Applied Bioinformatics & Ecological Network Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a reproducible bioinformatics pipeline for the analysis of plant–pollinator interaction networks using public biodiversity and genetic data.  
The project focuses on data integration, cleaning, network construction, and analytical modeling to extract biologically meaningful patterns.

The workflow is designed following best practices for **scientific reproducibility**, **data validation**, and **scalable analysis**.

---

## Objectives
- Integrate heterogeneous biological datasets from public repositories
- Clean, standardize, and validate large biological datasets
- Construct and analyze bipartite ecological networks
- Identify key species using network metrics
- Generate reproducible and interpretable analytical outputs

---

## Data Sources
- **GBIF** – Species occurrence records  
- **NCBI** – Genetic and taxonomic reference data  

> All data used are publicly available and properly cited.

## Methodology
1. Data acquisition and filtering  
2. Taxonomic standardization and validation  
3. Construction of bipartite interaction networks  
4. Network metrics computation (centrality, connectivity, species importance)  
5. Temporal and comparative analyses
